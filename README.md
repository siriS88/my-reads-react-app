# MyReads Project Overview

This is the MyReads Project using React. It allows a user to organize books into bookshelves based on
whether they are currently reading a book, would want to read it or they have already read it.
In addition to the user being able to move books between shelves, they are also able to search for new
books and add them to their book shelves.

The project uses the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
The template provides only static CSS and HTML markup but no React code.
